{\sffamily\noindent
  Your homework must be handed in \textbf{electronically via
  \href{\canvasURL}{Canvas} before \deadline}. This deadline is strict and late
  submissions are graded with a 0. At the end of the course, the lowest of your
  7 weekly homework grades will be dropped. You are strongly encouraged to work
  together on the exercises, including the homework. However, after this
  discussion phase, you have to write down and submit your own individual
  solution. Numbers alone are never sufficient, always motivate your answers.

\begin{exercise}[Football (4pt)]
  A football coach wants to analyze the performance of his team. After every
  week he registers the outcome of the match (\emph{win} or \emph{loose}, there
  are no ties) and how his team played (\emph{good}, \emph{fair} or
  \emph{hopeless}). Consider an experiment that consists of registering these
  things.
  
  % a)
  \begin{subex}[0.5pt]
    Give the sample space of this experiment.	
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)
  \begin{subex}[0.5pt]
    Let $A$ be the event that the team's performance was hopeless and $B$ the
    event that the team won. Specify the outcomes in $A$ and $B$.
  \end{subex}
  
  % c)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    Paraphrase the event $(\Omega \setminus A) \cup B$ and give all its
    outcomes.
  \end{subex}
  
  % d)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    After a couple of weeks, the coach analysed the data and came to the
    following conclusions: 1) His team is equally likely to win or loose; 2)
    his team is equally likely to play a good or a hopeless match, but 3)  fair
    performance is four times as likely as good performance. Finally, 4) they
    never win when they play a hopeless match and 5) never loose when they play
    a good match. Give a table describing the full probability function.
  \end{subex}
  
  % e)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    Last week's match has not been hopeless. What is the probability that
    they've won? (If you didn't solve part (d), use a fancy probability
    function of your choice, but make sure to include it in your solution.)
  \end{subex}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[A probability urn (3pt)]
  An urn contains 3 red balls, 5 green balls and one blue ball. You randomly
  draw a ball, don't put it back, but add two balls of the colors you did not
  draw. (For example: if you have drawn a red ball, add a green and a blue ball
  to the urn.) What is the probability that the second ball is red? (Hint: draw
  a tree!)
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[Probability functions (3pt)]
  Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$ be a finite probability space and $A, B\in
  \mathcal A$ two events.
  
  % a)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    Show that $P$ is \emph{monotone}: if $A \subseteq B$, then $P(A) \le P(B)$.
  \end{subex}

  % b)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    Show that if $A \subseteq B$, then $P(B \setminus A) = P(B) - P(A)$. Hints:
    use (a).
  \end{subex}

  % c)
  \begin{subex}[1pt]
    Now assume that $A$ and $B$ are independent and prove that $A^c = \Omega
    \setminus A$ and $B$ are also independent. (Note that $A\subseteq B$
    need not hold.) \emph{Hint: draw a Venn diagram and post a question to the
    forum if you need more hints.}
  \end{subex}
\end{exercise}
