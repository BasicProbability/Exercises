{\sffamily\noindent
  This week's exercises deal with joint distributions, covariance and
  correlation. You only have to hand in the homework problems; these exercises
  are optional and for practicing only. If you have questions about them,
  please post them to the \href{\discussionForumURL}{discussion forum} and try
  to help each other. We will also keep an eye on that.

\begin{exercise}[]
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables where $X$ takes values in $\{0, 6\}$
  and $Y$ in $\{-6, 0, 6\}$. Their joint distribution is given by 
  $P_{XY}(0,5) = P_{XY}(0, -5) = \frac{2}{12}$, $P_{XY}(5,-5) = \frac{5}{12}$
  and all other outcomes have probability $\frac{1}{12}$.

  % a)	
  \begin{subex}
    Find the cumulative distribution function $F_{XY}(x,y)$.	
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)  	
  \begin{subex}
    Find the marginal distributions $P_X$ and $P_Y$.	
  \end{subex}
  
  % c)
  \begin{subex}
    Are $X$ and $Y$ independent?	
  \end{subex}
  
  % d)
  \begin{subex}
    Find the covariance of $X$ and $Y$.
  \end{subex}
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[]
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent random variables with 
  $\Var[X] = \Var[Y] = 1$ and $E[X] = E[Y] = 2$.

  % a)
  \begin{subex}
    Calculate $\Cov(5X,6Y - 7)$.
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)
  \begin{subex}
    Calculate $\Cov(4X + Y, 6Y-6)$	
  \end{subex}
  
  % c)
  \begin{subex}
    What is $E[XY]$?	
  \end{subex}
\end{exercise}

%-------------

\begin{exercise}[]
  Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are random variables with the following joint pmf. Are
  $X$ and $Y$ independent?
  \[
	\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
			&$Y=1$	&$Y=2$	&$Y=3$\\\hline
	$X=1$	&$1/18$	&$1/9$	&$1/6$ \\\hline
	$X=2$	&$1/9$	&$1/6$	&$1/8$ \\\hline
	$X=3$	&$1/6$	&$1/18$	&$1/9$  \\\hline
	\end{tabular}
  \]
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[]
  Let $X$ be a random variable for which $P(X\ge 0)$ and $E[X]$ are both
  strictly positive. Show that $P(X>0)$ is strictly bigger than $0$.
\end{exercise}

%---------------
\begin{exercise}[]
  The \emph{Poisson distribution} models the number of time some event happens 
  in a given period of time. Its probability mass function is given by
  \[
    P(X = k) = {\frac {\lambda ^{k}e^{-\lambda }}{k!}}, 
      \qquad \lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}, \quad k=0,1,2,\dots
  \]
  where $\lambda$ is the distribution's only parameter.

  Suppose $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_x)$ and 
  $Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_y)$ are two independent variables.
  
  % a)
  \begin{subex}
    Show that $X+Y$ is $\text{Poisson}(\lambda_x + \lambda_y)$-distributed.
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)
  \begin{subex}
    Calculate $\Cov(X, Y)$.
  \end{subex}
\end{exercise}
