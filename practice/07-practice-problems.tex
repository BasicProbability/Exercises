  This week's exercises deal with the basics of information theory. You only
  have to hand in the homework problems; these exercises are optional and for
  practicing only. If you have questions about them, please post them to the
  \href{\discussionForumURL}{discussion forum} and try to help each other. We
  will also keep an eye on that.

\begin{exercise}[Entropies]
  Consider (i) a flip of a fair coin, (ii) a toss of a fair four-sided die, and
  (iii) a toss of a fair six-sided die. Let a RV $X$ encode (i), (ii) and (iii)
  and compute $H(X)$ in each case.
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[Binary entropies]
  A biased coin comes up heads with a probability of $\frac{2}{3}$. Compute the
  entropy of the outcome of six coin flips.
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[More entropy]
  Calculate the entropy of the following:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item pixel values whose possible values are all integers in $[0,255]$ with
      uniform probability,
    \item dogs sorted by whether or not they are mammals, 
    \item dogs sorted by whether they are older or not than the population's
      \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median}{median},
    \item RV $X$ with $P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{3}, P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{4}, P(X = 2)
      = \frac{1}{6}, P(X = 3) = \frac{1}{6}, P(X = 4) = \frac{1}{12}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

%---------------

\begin{exercise}[Joint and conditional entropy]
  Suppose that
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    P_{X}(x) & = & 1/6,\qquad x=1,2,\ldots,6;\\
    P_{Y|X}(y\,|\, x) & = & 1/x,\qquad y=1,2,\ldots,x.
  \end{eqnarray*}
  Compute $H(X)$, $H(Y \mid X)$, and $H(X,Y)$.
\end{exercise}
