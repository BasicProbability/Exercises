\begin{exercise}[Rolling Dice]
  
  % a)
  \begin{subex}
    Every member of your group rolls his/her 20-sided die.	
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)
  \begin{subex}
    Check if at least two of the die at your table show the same outcome.
  \end{subex}
  
  % c)
  \begin{subex}
    Repeat the experiment a few time and estimate the probability of this
    event.  	
  \end{subex}
  
  % d)
  \begin{subex}
    Define the sample space and probability function for this experiment.	
  \end{subex}
  
  % e)
  \begin{subex}
    Compute the probability of the event $A$ that at least two of the outcomes
    coincide. \emph{Hint: It might be easier to compute the probability of the 
    complement of $A$. What is this event?}
  \end{subex}

\begin{exercise}[Evil Squirrels]
  Consider 1.000.000 squirrels, 100 of them are evil and the rest is nice. The
  proposed alarm goes of when presented with an evil squirrel 99$\%$ of the
  time. But, it also goes of 1$\%$ of the time when presented with a nice
  squirrel.
  
  % a)  
  \begin{subex}
    If a squirrel sets off the alarm, what's the probability that it is evil?
  \end{subex}
  
  % b)
  \begin{subex}
    Based on this, should the evil squirrel detector be acquired?
  \end{subex}

\begin{exercise}[Monty Hall]
  A candidate in a TV show has to pick one of 3 doors. Behind one of the doors
  there is a car, and there are goats behind each of the two other doors. After
  the candidate has chosen, one of the doors with a goat is opened. The
  candidate is then given the choice to switch doors or to stick with his
  original choice

  Based on probabilistic calculations, should the	candidate switch doors or
  stick with his initial choice after one of the goats has been revealed?
  \emph{Hint: Start off with drawing a tree and computing the probability of
  winning the car when always switching the doors.}
