  A deck of cards contains 52 with \textbf{13 ranks} (2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10, J,
  Q, K, A) and \textbf{4 suits} ($ {\color{red} \heartsuit}, \spadesuit ,
  {\color{red} \diamondsuit}, \clubsuit $). A poker hand is a set of \textbf{5
  cards}. A \textbf{one-pair} is a poker hand with two cards having one rank
  and the remaining three cards having different ranks. For example: 
  $ \{2{\color{red} \heartsuit}, 2\spadesuit, 5{\color{red} \heartsuit},
  8\clubsuit, K{\color{red} \diamondsuit} \}  $
